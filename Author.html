            <h1> 2021 Movie Quiz - Author </h1>

            <p>
                Hi, my name is Matthew Gibson and I am currently studying Computing Science at Edinburgh Napier University. I am currently in my second year and am enrolled in Web Technologies, Software Engineering Methods and  an Algorithms and Data Structures module. This project is part of the coursework for Web Technologies which focuses on developing skills within HTML, CSS and the basics of Java Script. To show this I was tasked with developing a website which incorporates a quiz into it based on a subject of my choosing.
            </p> 

            <p>
                I am particularly interested in this module more so than the other two I am currently studying due to the fact that I have secured a placement for a web company in the first and second semester of third year which I hope to prepare for with this module and individual research / learning which I will do in my own time.
            </p>  
            <br>

                <img id="myImage"src="me2.jpeg" alt="myself (matthew) and some friends" height="400" width="600"> 
                <figcaption>Myself (far right) with some friends</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </center>
            <br>
            
            <p>
                Naturally, as I am a bit of a movie buff, I chose to do a quiz on something related to that, hence the subject 2021 Movies. Narrowing the scope of a general movie / entertainment quiz to 2021 movies allows me to focus on a smaller amount of movies in turn allowing myself to spend more time on thinking about implementing the quiz rather than coming up with quiz questions.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my off time I enjoy hanging out with my friends whether that be going to the cinema, grabbing something to eat, playing football or going to a night club.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
               As well as being a movie buff, I also enjoy comedy series a lot. My favourite is It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, a close second to that is Blue Mountain State and Arrested Development. 
               Furthermore, I like The Office, Parks and Recreation, New Girl, How I Met Your Mother and and animated shows like Archer, Family Guy, South Park and the simpsons, etc.
